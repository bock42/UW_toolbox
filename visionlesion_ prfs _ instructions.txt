
Exam card is in the Development folder, our scans are in 'Lesion Methods Part One'

(EVERY TIME you restart matlab do the following)

set path -> add with subfolders: MyDocuments/MATLAB/BoyntonFineMurray/UWToolbox/

cd to MyDocuments/MATLAB/BoyntonFineMurray/UWToolbox/Stimulus/pRFMapping (key so the 'data' directory is created/saved correctly)

open pRF_Mapping

make sure the stimulusType is 'Multifocal' or 'Meridians' (2+1)

set subject name (e.g. LM001)

run the script 

it'll start with the trigger from the scanner

copy mat files in the directory data/<subjname> (they save the time sequence of stimulus!)

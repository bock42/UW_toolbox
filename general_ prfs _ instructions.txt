Exam card is in the Final folder, pRFs (need to reset n. of runs and TRs) TRs = 240.
Do 5 runs (identical)

(EVERY TIME you restart matlab do the following)

set path -> add with subfolders: MyDocuments/MATLAB/BoyntonFineMurray/UWToolbox/

cd to MyDocuments/MATLAB/BoyntonFineMurray/UWToolbox/Stimulus/pRFMapping (critical!! this way the 'data' directory is created/saved correctly)

open pRF_Mapping

make sure the stimulusType is 'DriftingBar' (240TR)

set subject name 

run the script  -> set the 'seed' to 8194 (all the times!!)

the stimulus will start with the trigger from the scanner

copy mat files in the directory data/<subjname> (they save the time sequence of stimulus!)
